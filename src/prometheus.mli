(** Collect metrics for Prometheus.
    See: https://prometheus.io/

    Notes:

    - The Prometheus docs require that client libraries are thread-safe. We interpret this to mean safe
      with Lwt threads, NOT with native threading.

    - This library is intended to be a dependency of any library that might need to report metrics,
      even though many applications will not enable it. Therefore it should have minimal dependencies.
